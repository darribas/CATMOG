# CATMOG

The CATMOG reports describe advances in quantitative methods from the mid-1970s upto the early 1990s where many methods commonplace today were being developed. They represent core texts for those interested in the history behind quantitative methods in Geography. Writers include Stan Openshaw, Ron Johnston, Danny Dorling and many other renowned Quantitative Geographers. You can [view all the PDFs on GitHub](https://github.com/qmrg/CATMOG), or alternatively [download all CATMOG series as a .zip file](https://github.com/qmrg/CATMOG/zipball/Main) and a [.tar.gz file](https://github.com/qmrg/CATMOG/tarball/Main).
